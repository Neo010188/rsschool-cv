## About Me
#### I have been fond of computers for a long time, I like to repair, assemble, clean them. But it's time for something more, I want to learn how to program. I work as a mechanic in a government institution and I understand that it's time to change jobs! But where to go next? Well, my friend, who has already graduated as a programmer, suggested that I try it too. I tried it and I really liked it.
